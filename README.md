# Real_Time_Sentiment_Analysis_For_Customer_Feedback

## 🔍 Overview
This project is an end-to-end sentiment analysis system that uses a neural network to classify customer feedback as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. The model is served through a Streamlit web application for real-time predictions.

## 🎯 Objective
To build a deployable web app that allows users to input text and receive instant sentiment predictions using deep learning models.

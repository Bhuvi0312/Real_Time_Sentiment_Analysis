# Real_Time_Sentiment_Analysis_For_Customer_Feedback

## 🔍 Overview
This project is an end-to-end sentiment analysis system that uses a neural network to classify customer feedback as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. The model is served through a Streamlit web application for real-time predictions.

## 🎯 Objective
To build a deployable web app that allows users to input text and receive instant sentiment predictions using deep learning models.

## 🧠 Model
- **Architecture**: BERT (Pre-trained)
- **Framework**: PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers
- **Task**: Multi-class classification (Positive, Negative, Neutral)

## Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score

##  Ethical Considerations
✅ No user data is stored

✅ Model trained on balanced data

❗ May require improvements in bias mitigation and interpretability
